# ESOZoneNameLoggerAddon
Elder Scrolls Online Zone Name Logger Addon

Very simple addon that logs to chat whenever you change zones. The format is "--Entered (Zone Name)--"

You can turn the addon on/off using the /znl chat command. The command will first switch it on/off and then tell you the current status of it.

Subtly different from the NowTalking addon: the format of the message is different, and provided a chat command to toggle on/off.
